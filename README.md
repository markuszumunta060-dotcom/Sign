🌐 Google Clarity Web3 Procurement Contract

This project is a **Clarity smart contract** designed to model how a large organization (like Google) could manage procurement on **Web3**.  
It allows enterprises to **post projects**, vendors to **submit bids**, and the system to **automatically choose the winning contract** in a transparent, tamper-proof way.

---

✨ Core Features
- **Project Creation** → Enterprises post project requirements with a budget.  
- **Vendor Bidding** → Multiple vendors submit bids with proposed costs.  
- **Winner Selection** → The contract automatically selects the **lowest bid** as the winner.  
- **Transparency** → All projects, bids, and winners are permanently recorded on-chain.  
- **Fairness** → No hidden deals, no corruption—every vendor competes equally.
